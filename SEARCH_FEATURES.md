# Enhanced Search & Location Features

## üîç New Search Features

### Advanced Search Bar
- **Location Search**: Search events by location, venue, or address
- **Date Range Filters**: Filter by upcoming, today, this week, this month
- **Distance Filter**: Find events within specific distance (requires location access)
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date, distance, participants, or creation date
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with instant results

### Location Services
- **Geolocation Support**: Use "Near me" to find events based on your location
- **Distance Calculation**: Shows distance to each event when location is enabled
- **Location Accuracy**: Displays GPS accuracy information
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when location services are unavailable

### Enhanced Loading States
- **Contextual Loading**: Different loading indicators for search, location, events
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear indication of what's happening
- **Error Recovery**: Retry options for failed operations

## üß≠ Distance Calculation

The app uses the **Haversine formula** to calculate distances between coordinates:
- Accurate calculation of distances in kilometers
- Handles edge cases and coordinate validation
- Optimized for performance with caching

### Mock Geocoding
Currently includes mock coordinates for common cities:
- New York, London, Paris, Tokyo
- San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago
- Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, etc.

*In production, replace with real geocoding service (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)*

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```typescript
// Search by location
filters.location = "New York"

// Filter by date range
filters.dateRange = "upcoming"

// Sort by date
filters.sortBy = "date"
filters.sortOrder = "asc"
```

### Location-Based Search
```typescript
// Get user location
const location = await getUserLocation();

// Calculate distances
const eventsWithDistance = calculateEventDistances(events, location);

// Filter by distance
filters.maxDistance = 10; // 10km radius
```

### Advanced Filtering
```typescript
// Complex filter example
const filters = {
  location: "San Francisco",
  dateRange: "this-week",
  maxDistance: 25,
  sortBy: "distance",
  sortOrder: "asc"
};

const results = filterAndSortEvents(events, filters, userLocation);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real Geocoding**: Integration with Google Maps API
- **Category Filters**: Filter events by category/type
- **Price Range**: Filter by ticket price
- **Saved Searches**: Save frequently used search criteria
- **Push Notifications**: Alert when new events match saved searches

### Performance Improvements
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle large numbers of events
